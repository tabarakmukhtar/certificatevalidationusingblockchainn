# 🎓 Certificate Validation Using Blockchain

A blockchain-based web application that verifies and validates certificates securely using **SHA-256 hashing**.  
This project ensures that issued certificates cannot be forged or altered, providing authenticity through a decentralized ledger-like structure.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Upload and validate certificates
- 🔒 Blockchain-like data storage using SHA-256 hashing
- 🧩 Admin and Institution login system
- 🕵️ Tamper-proof verification mechanism
- 💾 Secure data storage in MySQL
- ⚡ Simple web interface using Flask

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 🔹 Workflow
1. **Institution uploads** a certificate.  
2. Flask backend generates a **unique SHA-256 hash** for that certificate.  
3. Each hash is stored as a **block** in the database, linked with the previous block (`previous_hash`).  
4. When verifying, the uploaded certificate’s hash is recomputed and compared with the stored hash.  
5. If both hashes match → the certificate is **valid**, otherwise it is **invalid**.
